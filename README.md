# Gender-Prediction-Excel
- We are given a bunch of names and we have to predict the gender of the person based on the name. Now, how shall we go about it?
- The method that we will follow here is to use the last letter of a person's name to predict their gender
- We have used the Naive Bayes method without creating a model using python, to simulate and understand the concept and the working of the algorithm
The Gender Predictions are made using the Naive Bayes Theorem. There are two different methods used to evaluate the accuracy:
- Basic Probability
- Confusion Matrix and F1 Score
  
This is all done using Excel! Take a look and let me know in the comments if you have done something innovative using Excel
